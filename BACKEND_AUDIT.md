# EventTrust Nigeria — Backend Audit & Compliance Analysis

> **Generated:** 2026-03-19 | **Last updated:** 2026-03-24
> **Phase:** End of Phase 1, entering Phase 2 — Backend Sprint 2 item M5 implemented
> **Scope:** Backend only (`apps/api/`). Frontend audit is in `FRONTEND_AUDIT.md`.

## Quick Wins (CEO View)

These are the highest-leverage fixes — small effort, outsized production risk reduction:

| # | Fix | Why It Matters | Effort |
|---|-----|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Env validation on startup | App silently boots with missing JWT_SECRET or DB credentials — next Railway deploy could be broken and no one would know | 2–3h |
| 2 | Sentry in GlobalExceptionFilter | Backend 500s are invisible in production right now — no alert, no trace, just a Pino log that nobody reads | 1h |
| 3 | `findUnique` soft-delete gap | Deleted vendors/users/listings can be fetched by direct ID — a deleted vendor profile remains accessible | 2–3h |
| 4 | CSRF exclusion on `/invoices/:id/confirm` — verify token validation | The endpoint is public and excluded from CSRF — if `confirm(id)` trusts the ID alone with no shared secret, any invoice can be confirmed by anyone who guesses or enumerates an ID | 1–2h |
| 5 | Termii silent failure alert | OTP SMS can silently fail after 3 retries — user receives no code, cannot log in, and backend returns 200 OK | 1h |
| 6 | Tests for Phase 2+ modules | budgets, guest-lists, inquiries, invoices, invoice-branding, clients — 6 production modules with zero test coverage | 8–12h |

## Legend & Scope

**Severity:**
- 🟠 **High** — security gap, data integrity risk, or silent production failure
- 🟡 **Medium** — type safety gap, logic edge case, or missing endpoint
- 🟢 **Low** — polish, missing test coverage, or minor inconsistency

**Scope:** `apps/api/` only. Frontend (`apps/web/`) audit is in `AUDIT.md`.

**Codebase as of audit date:**
- 18 modules, ~106 TypeScript files, 17 spec files
- 32+ passing unit tests
- CLAUDE.md specifies 13 modules for Phase 1; the actual codebase ships 18 production-ready modules (5 Phase 2+ modules fully built)

---

## 1. Codebase Audit — Compliance with CLAUDE.md

### ✅ What's Compliant

**Security architecture:**
- `AuditService.log()` called on every state-changing endpoint across all modules — zero gaps found
- `ZodValidationPipe` with `@eventtrust/shared` schemas on all POST/PATCH endpoints
- Admin endpoints all have `RolesGuard` + `@Roles('ADMIN')` — no unguarded admin routes found
- Owner guards cover all mutation endpoints: `VendorOwnerGuard`, `ListingOwnerGuard`, `ReviewOwnerGuard`, `BudgetOwnerGuard`, `DisputeOwnerGuard`, `GuestListOwnerGuard`, `InvoiceOwnerGuard`
- JWT in httpOnly cookies only — never in response body or localStorage
- CSRF double-submit cookie pattern correctly wired in `csrf.middleware.ts` + `app.module.ts`
- Refresh token rotation with reuse detection and family revocation (`auth.service.ts:159–166`)
- OTP rate limiting: 3 req/10min via DB count check; 5 verify attempts max with exponential backoff
- Soft deletes via Prisma `$extends` on `User`, `Vendor`, `Review`, `Listing` — `.delete()` and `.deleteMany()` both intercepted

**Infrastructure:**
- `Helmet`, `CORS`, `cookie-parser` all applied in `main.ts`
- `GlobalExceptionFilter` maps Prisma errors: `P2002 → 409`, `P2025 → 404`
- No raw SQL — all queries go through Prisma ORM
- No direct cross-module service imports (only foundational services: `PrismaService`, `AuditService`, `JwtService`)
- Global `JwtAuthGuard` as `APP_GUARD` — all routes protected unless `@Public()` is explicit
- `@nestjs/throttler` global rate limiter: 60 requests/60s per IP
- `ScheduleModule` wired for cron tasks
- Pino structured logging with pino-pretty in dev, JSON in production
- `ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true })` — env vars accessible everywhere

**Data integrity:**
- `admin_log` is append-only — no update/delete calls to it anywhere in codebase
- `auth_identities` correctly created on first OTP verify (phone provider)
- Phone numbers validated to E.164 format via Zod schema in `@eventtrust/shared` before reaching any service
- Argon2 for OTP code hashing — not stored in plaintext
- Refresh tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes only — raw tokens never in DB

---

### 🟠 High Priority Issues

#### H1 — No Env Validation on Startup

- **File:** `apps/api/src/main.ts`, `apps/api/src/app.module.ts`
- **Problem:** `main.ts` calls `NestFactory.create(AppModule)` with no startup validation of required environment variables. `ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true })` is present but has no `validate` function attached.
  Required vars not validated: `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, `TERMII_API_KEY`, `TERMII_SENDER_ID`, `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `SENTRY_DSN`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`
- **Impact:** The app can boot and serve requests with missing secrets. JWT signing will silently use an empty string as the secret — tokens will be generated but with no security. Termii will silently fail. A Railway deploy with a misconfigured env will start healthy but be broken.
- **Evidence:** `main.ts:8` — `NestFactory.create(AppModule, { bufferLogs: true })` — no validation step before `app.listen(port)`.
- **Fix:** Add `validate` to `ConfigModule.forRoot()` using a Zod schema. Throw on missing required vars. The app will refuse to start rather than start broken.

#### H2 — No Sentry Integration in GlobalExceptionFilter

- **File:** `apps/api/src/common/filters/global-exception.filter.ts`
- **Problem:** `GlobalExceptionFilter` logs 5xx errors to Pino (`this.logger.error(...)`) but never calls `Sentry.captureException()`. Production backend crashes are invisible — no alert, no trace, no grouping.
- **Evidence:** `global-exception.filter.ts:46` — `this.logger.error(exception.message, exception.stack)` — Pino only. No Sentry import in the file.
- **Impact:** Unhandled exceptions, unexpected Prisma errors, and service failures produce zero monitoring signal. Bugs go undetected until users complain.
- **Fix:** Import `@sentry/nestjs`, call `Sentry.captureException(exception)` for all non-`HttpException` paths (i.e., genuine 5xx errors). 4xx `HttpException`s should generally not be sent to Sentry as they are expected user errors.

#### H3 — `findUnique()` Bypasses Soft-Delete Filter

- **File:** `apps/api/src/prisma/prisma.service.ts`
- **Problem:** The Prisma `$extends` soft-delete middleware intercepts `findFirst` and `findMany` and injects `deletedAt: null`. The `findUnique` branch (line 40–45) is a deliberate no-op pass-through with a comment: `"findUnique doesn't support deletedAt filter directly, so we let it pass and check after"` — but no post-query check was implemented.
- **Evidence:** `prisma.service.ts:40–46`:
  ```ts
  async findUnique({ model, args, query }) {
    if (SOFT_DELETE_MODELS.includes(model)) {
      // findUnique doesn't support deletedAt filter directly,
      // so we let it pass and check after
    }
    return query(args);  // ← no filter applied, no post-check
  }
  ```
- **Impact:** Any service that calls `prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id } })` or `prisma.vendor.findUnique(...)` will return soft-deleted records. Deleted users can be fetched by `auth.service.ts:getUser()`. A deleted vendor profile remains accessible at its public endpoint.
- **Affected services:** `auth.service.ts:103,235`, any service using `findUnique` on soft-delete models.
- **Fix:** Replace `findUnique` calls on soft-delete models with `findFirst({ where: { id, deletedAt: null } })` in all service methods, OR implement a post-query null check inside the extension. The first approach is safer and more explicit.

#### H4 — CSRF Excluded for `POST /invoices/:id/confirm` — No Token Validation

- **File:** `apps/api/src/app.module.ts:87`, `apps/api/src/invoices/invoices.controller.ts:67–73`
- **Problem:** `POST /invoices/:id/confirm` is explicitly excluded from CSRF middleware and decorated `@Public()` (no JWT required). The `confirm(id)` method calls `this.invoicesService.confirm(id)` with only the invoice ID as input — no shared secret or signed token in the URL.
- **Evidence:**
  - `app.module.ts:87`: `{ path: 'invoices/:id/confirm', method: RequestMethod.POST }`
  - `invoices.controller.ts:67–73`: `async confirm(@Param('id') id: string)` — no additional parameter
- **Impact:** If invoice IDs are UUIDs (not guessable), risk is low but not zero — a UUID v4 is 122 bits of entropy, but IDs can be leaked via URLs, emails, or browser history. If invoice IDs are sequential integers, any invoice can be confirmed by enumeration. The CSRF exclusion rationale (client has no session) is valid, but the lack of a confirmation token means the endpoint has no authorization check at all.
- **Fix:** Verify that `invoicesService.confirm(id)` validates a signed token passed as a query param or body field, or that the invoice ID cannot be enumerated. If neither is true, add a `confirmToken` field to the Invoice model and require it on this endpoint.

---

### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

#### M1 — `as any` Role Coercion in `auth.service.ts`

- **File:** `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts:127, 189, 246`
- **Problem:** `role: user.role as any` bypasses TypeScript's type system. `user.role` comes from Prisma as a `Role` enum value, but is cast to `any` before assignment to `AuthUser.role`.
- **Evidence:** Three identical patterns at lines 127, 189, 246:
  ```ts
  role: user.role as any,
  ```
- **Impact:** If `UserRole` enum in `@eventtrust/shared` drifts from the Prisma `Role` enum (e.g., a new role is added to DB schema but not shared package), the cast silently maps it to an unknown value that passes type checks. The JWT payload will contain an unrecognized role, and `RolesGuard` will silently fail to grant access.
- **Fix:** Import the Prisma `Role` enum and validate against `UserRole` before assignment. Throw if an unknown role is encountered.

#### M2 — `metadata as any` Cast in `audit.service.ts`

- **File:** `apps/api/src/audit/audit.service.ts:23`
- **Problem:** `details: params.metadata ? (params.metadata as any) : undefined` — the `metadata` field is cast to `any` before being written to `admin_log.details` (a Prisma `Json` field).
- **Evidence:** `audit.service.ts:23`.
- **Impact:** Prisma `Json` fields accept `any`, so functionally this works. The risk is that `details` has no typed schema — callers can pass arbitrary shapes that are inconsistent across audit events, making the `admin_log` table hard to query and analyze.
- **Fix:** Define a union type `AuditDetails` for known audit event shapes. Low urgency since the cast is technically correct, but important for the admin audit log viewer (see AUDIT.md GAP-D3).

#### M3 — `PhoneThrottlerGuard` Falls Back to IP

- **File:** `apps/api/src/common/guards/phone-throttler.guard.ts`
- **Problem:** `getTracker` returns `req.body?.phone || req.ip`. If the request body doesn't contain a `phone` field — or if someone sends a request without a body — the throttler uses the caller's IP as the rate limit key instead of the phone number.
- **Evidence:** `phone-throttler.guard.ts:7`: `return req.body?.phone || req.ip;`
- **Impact:** An attacker could send malformed requests (no `phone` field) and only be rate-limited by IP, which is trivially bypassed with rotating IPs or proxies. Phone-based OTP rate limiting is the primary anti-SMS-bombing control (Termii costs money per SMS).
- **Fix:** If `req.body?.phone` is absent, throw `BadRequestException('Phone is required')` rather than falling back to IP. The OTP endpoint always requires a phone — a missing phone is an invalid request, not a valid one to throttle by IP.

#### M4 — No XSS Sanitization on Free-Text Fields

- **Files:** `apps/api/src/vendors/vendors.service.ts`, `apps/api/src/reviews/reviews.service.ts`, `apps/api/src/listings/listings.service.ts`
- **Problem:** Free-text fields (`description`, `businessName`, `replyText`, `listingTitle`, `listingDescription`) are stored without HTML sanitization. Zod schemas validate length and format but do not strip HTML tags.
- **Impact:** If any frontend component renders these fields with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or a markdown renderer without sanitization, stored XSS is possible. While the current Next.js frontend uses React (which escapes by default), future admin panels, email templates, or third-party integrations may not.
- **Fix:** Add `sanitize-html` or `dompurify` (server-side via jsdom) in service layer before DB writes on `description`, `replyText`, and similar fields. Strip all tags — these fields should be plain text only.

#### ~~M5 — No `/listings/similar` Endpoint~~ ✅ Fixed 2026-03-24

- **Files:** `apps/api/src/listings/listings.service.ts`, `apps/api/src/listings/listings.controller.ts`
- Added `findSimilar(listingId, limit)` to `ListingsService`. Matches on `listingType` + `category` (SERVICE) or `rentalDetails.rentalCategory` (RENTAL), active vendors only, ordered by `createdAt DESC`, limited to 4.
- Added `GET /listings/:id/similar?limit=4` to `ListingsController` (placed before `:id` route to avoid NestJS route conflict).
- Frontend listing detail page updated to call this endpoint instead of `GET /listings`.

---

### 🟢 Low Priority / Polish

#### L1 — Termii SMS Silent Failure

- **File:** `apps/api/src/auth/services/termii.service.ts`
- **Problem:** After 3 failed attempts, `sendOtp` logs `this.logger.error(...)` and returns `void` — no exception is thrown, no alert is triggered, and `requestOtp` in `auth.service.ts` returns `{ message: 'OTP sent successfully' }` even when the SMS was never delivered.
- **Evidence:** `termii.service.ts:53`: `this.logger.error(\`Failed to send OTP to ${phone} after ${maxRetries} attempts\`)`
- **Impact:** Users cannot log in without the OTP code. They will retry, hit rate limits, and be locked out. Support volume will spike. In production this will be invisible until users complain.
- **Fix:** On final retry failure, throw a `ServiceUnavailableException` so `auth.service.ts` propagates the error to the client. Also add a Sentry alert (once H2 is fixed) on this path. In development (where `isDev = true`), the silent log is fine — only affect production behavior.

#### L2 — No Test Files for Phase 2+ Modules

- **Modules without spec files:** `budgets`, `guest-lists`, `inquiries`, `invoices`, `invoice-branding`, `clients`
- **Problem:** All 6 Phase 2+ modules that are currently production-deployed have zero test coverage. All Phase 1 modules have at least one spec file.
- **Impact:** Regressions in invoice creation, budget tracking, and client inquiry flows are undetected. These are the modules most recently modified and most likely to change.
- **Fix:** Add at minimum one service-level spec file per module covering the happy path and key error cases. Priority order: `invoices` → `inquiries` → `budgets` → `clients` → `guest-lists` → `invoice-branding`.

#### L3 — `app.module.spec.ts` Excluded from Test Runs Indefinitely

- **File:** `apps/api/src/app.module.spec.ts`
- **Problem:** This spec file is excluded from the Vitest unit test config because it requires Express at runtime. The comment implies it should be an integration test but it has not been moved to the integration test suite.
- **Impact:** The app module wiring (guard registration, middleware binding, module imports) is never tested.
- **Fix:** Move to `apps/api/test/` as an integration test using a real NestJS test application. It should run in the `test:e2e` suite, not be excluded indefinitely from unit tests.

#### L4 — `AuditService` Field Name Mapping — Verify Alignment

- **File:** `apps/api/src/audit/audit.service.ts`
- **Problem:** The `AuditService.log()` interface uses `{ action, actorId, targetType, targetId, metadata }` but the `admin_log` Prisma model uses `{ action, adminId, entityType, entityId, details }`. The mapping is done manually inside `audit.service.ts`.
- **Evidence:** `audit.service.ts:18–24` — `adminId: params.actorId`, `entityType: params.targetType`, `entityId: params.targetId`, `details: params.metadata`.
- **Impact:** The mapping is correct as implemented. The risk is that a future developer calling `AuditService.log()` may confuse `actorId` with `adminId` semantics (the audit log was designed for admins, but `actorId` is now any user). Not a bug today, but a source of confusion.
- **Fix:** Add a comment in `AuditService.log()` clarifying that `actorId` maps to `adminId` in storage and that non-admin actors (vendors, clients) are also valid callers. Low urgency.

```

**CSRF exclusions (documented):**
- `POST /auth/otp/request` — pre-auth, no session
- `POST /auth/otp/verify` — pre-auth, no session
- `POST /auth/refresh` — uses refresh token from httpOnly cookie; CSRF not applicable
- `GET /auth/csrf-token` — issues the CSRF token
- `GET /health` — public health check
- `POST /invoices/:id/confirm` — public client confirmation ⚠️ **(see H4)**

## 5. Missing Endpoints

Cross-referencing with `AUDIT.md` frontend gaps:

| Endpoint | Priority | Frontend Gap | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| ~~`GET /listings/:id/similar?limit=4`~~ | ✅ Done | FRONTEND_AUDIT.md H3 | Implemented 2026-03-24 |
| `GET /admin/audit-log` | 🟡 | FRONTEND_AUDIT.md GAP-D3 | Audit log exists in DB but no read endpoint for admin UI |
| `POST /vendors/:id/notify` | 🟢 | FRONTEND_AUDIT.md GAP-C4 | Confirm Resend email notification is triggered on status change |

---

## 6. Test Coverage Gaps

| Module | Missing | Priority | Rationale |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `invoices` | Service unit tests, status machine tests | 🟠 | Most complex state machine in Phase 2; actively used |
| `inquiries` | Service unit tests | 🟠 | Core CRM flow; inquiry status transitions untested |
| `budgets` | Service unit tests | 🟡 | Client-facing; item CRUD and totals untested |
| `clients` | Service unit tests | 🟡 | Profile creation and lookup untested |
| `guest-lists` | Service unit tests | 🟡 | Bulk add and RSVP tracking untested |
| `invoice-branding` | Service unit tests | 🟢 | Simple CRUD; lower risk |
| `notifications` | Service unit tests | 🟡 | Email delivery mocked but not tested |
| `app.module.spec.ts` | Integration test suite | 🟢 | Module wiring never verified |

## 7. Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1 — Security & Reliability Fixes

> Goal: No silent production failures; deleted records can't be fetched; CSRF confirm endpoint audited.

| # | Task | Severity | Est. |
|---|------|----------|------|
| 1 | Add env validation (`ConfigModule.forRoot` + Zod `validate` function) | 🟠 | 2h |
